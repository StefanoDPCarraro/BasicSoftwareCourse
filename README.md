Creating this repostiry to store and show progress the progress I have made with my udemy course in C that I am studying.

To run the files:
First you have to download a C compiler such as GCC so you can compile and then run the app.

You then have to type in the console:
gcc "FILE PATH" -o "exe intended name"
./"exe name"
ps: Remember to substitute the quotation marks and its words for you preferrable words.

If trying to compile a file that depends on other header files you have to declare all the .c files that you will need.
